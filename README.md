AI-Based Disk Scheduling Optimization using Genetic Algorithm
This project compares traditional **Disk Scheduling Algorithms** , **FCFS**, **SSTF**, and **SCAN** with an **optimized Genetic Algorithm** to minimize total disk head movement. The goal is to improve seek efficiency in Operating Systems.
# Fetaures
